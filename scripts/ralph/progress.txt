## Codebase Patterns
- Root is npm workspaces monorepo (`apps/*`, `packages/*`), but `services/ws-server` is NOT in workspaces — it has its own standalone `package.json` and `node_modules`
- Docker compose uses `context: .` (repo root) for all services; Dockerfiles must use paths relative to repo root (e.g., `COPY services/ws-server/package.json ./`)
- Existing app Dockerfiles have 3 stages: `deps` → `builder` → `runner`; ws-server uses 2 stages: `deps` (install + compile) → `runner`
- `docker-compose.dev.yml` uses `target: deps` to stop at dependency install stage, then runs dev commands via bind-mounted volumes

## 2026-02-20 - US-001
- Implemented standalone Socket.io WebSocket server at `services/ws-server/`
- Created `package.json` with `socket.io`, `typescript`, `ts-node-dev` dependencies
- Created `tsconfig.json` targeting Node 20 (ES2020, commonjs)
- Created `src/index.ts` with HTTP + Socket.io server on `process.env.PORT ?? 3002`, CORS `origin: '*'`
- Created multi-stage `Dockerfile` (deps + runner) based on `node:20-alpine`
- Added `ws` service to `docker-compose.yml` (production) and `docker-compose.dev.yml` (dev with hot reload)
- Files changed: `services/ws-server/package.json`, `services/ws-server/tsconfig.json`, `services/ws-server/src/index.ts`, `services/ws-server/Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.dev.yml`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Docker build context is `.` (repo root), so all `COPY` paths in Dockerfiles must be relative to repo root
  - The ws-server has its own separate `npm install` — NOT part of the root workspace
  - `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml build ws` succeeded cleanly
  - TypeScript typecheck (`npx tsc --noEmit`) passes with no errors

## 2026-02-20 - US-002
- Implemented in-memory room state and event handlers for Socket.io server
- Created `services/ws-server/src/types.ts` with `User`, `Stroke`, `StickyNote`, `RoomState` interfaces
- Created `services/ws-server/src/rooms.ts` with `Map<roomId, RoomState>`, `getOrCreateRoom`, `deleteRoomIfEmpty`
- Updated `services/ws-server/src/index.ts` to handle all canvas sync events: `join_room`, `cursor_move`, `stroke_add`, `sticky_add`, `sticky_update`, `canvas_clear`, and `disconnect`
- Files changed: `services/ws-server/src/types.ts`, `services/ws-server/src/rooms.ts`, `services/ws-server/src/index.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Track `currentRoomId` as a closure variable per socket connection for clean disconnect handling
  - `canvas_clear` must use `io.to(roomId)` (not `socket.to`) to include the sender
  - `join_room` sends `room_state` with `users: Array.from(room.users.values())` since Maps aren't JSON-serializable
  - TypeScript `Map` non-null assertions (`!`) are safe after checking `has()` or after `set()`

## 2026-02-20 - US-003
- Replaced `apps/app/app/page.tsx` with a lobby/home page for creating or joining rooms
- Lobby renders on `#080012` background with a `#12002B` card
- Card has: 'D' logo mark (purple `#8B5CF6` rounded square), 'Dex's Playbook' heading in Plus Jakarta Sans, 'Create a room' button (purple, rounded-full), divider, and join input + 'Join' button
- 'Create a room' generates 8-char alphanumeric roomId via `Math.random().toString(36).slice(2, 10)` and navigates with `router.push`
- Join input extracts roomId from URL (regex `/\/room\/([a-z0-9]+)/i`) or treats input as raw roomId; 'Join' button disabled when input is empty
- Files changed: `apps/app/app/page.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Plus Jakarta Sans is already configured in `layout.tsx` as `var(--font-jakarta)` CSS variable
  - The room route `/room/[roomId]` doesn't exist yet (created in US-004); lobby nav code is correct and will work once route is created
  - `npx next build` (from `apps/app/` dir) is the right way to verify the Next.js build
