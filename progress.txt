## Codebase Patterns
- Next.js app uses `@/` path alias mapping to the app root (`apps/app/`)
- Canvas component is at `apps/app/components/CanvasWorkspace.tsx`
- Lobby page is at `apps/app/app/page.tsx`; room pages go under `apps/app/app/room/[roomId]/`
- Use `"use client"` directive for all interactive pages/components
- Layout uses Plus Jakarta Sans via CSS variable `--font-jakarta`
- Color palette: bg `#080012`, card `#1A0533`, primary purple `#8B5CF6`
- Typecheck: `cd apps/app && npx tsc --noEmit`
- Custom hooks live in `apps/app/hooks/`; socket hook is `useRoom.ts`
- `socket.io-client` v4 is installed; WS URL from `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL` env var (default `http://localhost:3002`)
- `useRoom` hook uses `useRef` to hold the socket, returns it for emit calls by callers

- What was implemented: Created `apps/app/app/room/[roomId]/page.tsx` — a Next.js dynamic route that renders the CanvasWorkspace behind a display-name modal. Modal blocks the canvas until user enters a name (max 20 chars) and clicks "Join Room" or presses Enter. On submit, a random color is picked from the standard COLORS array and stored in component state alongside the name.
- Files changed: `apps/app/app/room/[roomId]/page.tsx` (created)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `useParams()` from `next/navigation` provides `roomId` in client components inside the `[roomId]` segment
  - Modal is rendered as an absolutely positioned overlay with `z-50`; the canvas renders underneath at all times (no conditional render of CanvasWorkspace) which avoids remounting
  - TypeScript path alias `@/components/CanvasWorkspace` resolves correctly from any nested route
  - `autoFocus` on the name input works without needing a manual `ref.current.focus()` call in useEffect

- What was implemented: Created `apps/app/hooks/useRoom.ts` — a custom React hook that manages the Socket.io connection lifecycle. Installed `socket.io-client` v4 in `apps/app`. Created `apps/app/.env.local.example` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=http://localhost:3002`.
- Files changed: `apps/app/hooks/useRoom.ts` (created), `apps/app/.env.local.example` (created), `apps/app/package.json` (socket.io-client added), `package-lock.json` (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Hook returns `socket` directly (from a `useRef`) so callers can call `socket.emit(...)` for outbound events (stroke_add, cursor_move, etc.)
  - `remoteCursors` is a `Map<socketId, { x, y, name, color }>` — use state setter with `new Map(prev)` to trigger re-renders
  - `user_left` handler must also remove the departing user from `remoteCursors` to prevent stale cursor overlays
  - The `"use client"` directive at the top of hooks files is needed for Next.js App Router compatibility when the hook uses browser APIs
  - `.env.local` is already gitignored; `.env.local.example` is NOT (different pattern, not a wildcard match)
